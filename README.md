FlytBase AEGIS
AI-Native Security Operations Interface for Autonomous Drone Fleets
FlytBase AEGIS is a next-generation conceptual interface designed for autonomous intrusion detection, response, and forensic evidence generation. Unlike traditional security dashboards built for manual monitoring, AEGIS is a decision-supervision system designed for high-autonomy environments where seconds matter and legal reliability is paramount.


🛡️ The Challenge: Supervision Under Pressure

``` bash
Most security systems fail when transitioning to autonomy because they overwhelm the human operator with raw data. In a real-world drone-based security incident:

Speed: Events unfold faster than a human can process.

Scale: One operator cannot manually pilot multiple drones while analyzing feeds.

Compliance: Every autonomous action must be explainable and legally auditable.

AEGIS solves this by shifting the human role from "Operator" to "Validator."
```

🔄 The Three-Phase Tactical Flow
The interface is architected around the chronological lifecycle of a security breach.

``` bash

Phase 1: Intelligent Alerting (Verification)
The system filters out the noise, surfacing only verified threats to prevent "alarm fatigue."

AI Action: Automatically launches the nearest drone and runs computer vision diagnostics.

UI Focus: High-confidence metrics only (Intruder count, precise location, and AI confidence score).

Human Role: A binary "Proceed" or "Stand Down" decision.

```
``` bash

Phase 2: Autonomous Response (Engagement)
Once confirmed, the system enters a proactive tactical mode.

AI Action: Predicts intruder exit paths and suggests intercept maneuvers or perimeter lockouts.

UI Focus: Execution states. Instead of "How do I fly?", the operator sees "What is the drone doing next?"

Human Role: Approving AI-suggested maneuvers (e.g., Deploy Perimeter Drone 2 or Activate Site Audio Deterrent).

```

``` bash

Phase 3: Evidence & Chain of Custody (Resolution)
Post-incident, the system automatically transitions from a tactical tool to a legal one.

AI Action: Compiles a multi-angle incident timeline and identifies key frames for legal evidence.

UI Focus: A tamper-proof audit trail and structured incident report.

Human Role: Reviewing and signing off on the generated report for insurance or law enforcement.

```

Key Design Principles

``` bash

AI leads, human validates

Reduced cognitive load under pressure

Explainability over raw data

Audit-ready evidence by default

The interface avoids unnecessary controls, charts, or dashboards in favor of clear decisions and system accountability.

```


AI in the Design Process

``` bash

AI tools were used as assistive tools for rapid iteration and prototyping, helping explore layouts and interaction states.

All product decisions, system behavior, and interaction flows were intentionally designed based on:

Real-world security constraints

Operator stress scenarios

Autonomous system design principles

AI supported the process — it did not define the product thinking.
```
